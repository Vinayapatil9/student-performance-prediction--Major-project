# student-performance-prediction--Major-project
 Students opting engineering as their disciple is increasing rapidly. But due to various factors and inappropriate primary education in India dropout rates are high. Students are unable to excel in core engineering subjects which are complex and mathematical, hence mostly get drop / keep term (kt) in that subject. With the help of data mining techniques we can predict the performance of students in terms of grades and dropout for a subject can be predicted. In the proposed system, Naïve Bayes algorithm is used. Based on the rules obtained from the developed technique, the system can derive the key factors inﬂuencing student performance.
